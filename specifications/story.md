A mentor's life @ Codecool.

At first the initialization of the mentor and the student begins from the respective CSV files.
After the mentor and the students are found the mentors names will be written out.
There will be an attendance call for each student and those who are present say "I'm here".

The mentor checks the overall energy of the students.
if it is low (...it will be...) than some gymnastics will be done.
And also some coffee will be drunk. in both cases the energy level will increase with a random amount.

The Mentor begins teaching something programing related.

At 11:45 a bell rings which is indicating lunch time. Mentors and students are eating.

At 13:00 a Mentor tells a joke and is giving a motivational speech to energize the students.
Some students will behave badly to boost their energy.
Some will also study some which will decrease the energy level and increase their knowledge level.

15:00 a bell rings again which indicates the end of the school day.
